The Satavahanas were overpowered by the Ikshvakus by the third century AD. During this period Brahmanism is said to have been revived. This reduced the influence of the Buddhist which was fostered by the Satavahanas.<br>By the end of the third century AD the Pallavas of Kanchi put an end to the rule of the Ikshavakus. Art and Architecture advanced during their rule. By 4th century AD the Anandas established their rule which lasted till 6th century. During the 7th century the Eastern Chalukyas exercised  their power for about four centuries. Literature was advanced during this period with promotion of the Telegu script. The Kakatiyas who were the feudatories of the Eastern Chalukyas became independent in about the 12th century. During the rule of Delhi Sultanate, Muslims repeatedly attempted intrution into Andhra. In 1332 AD Ulugh Khan established themselves. The Reddi Kingdom of Kondavidu; the Velama kingdom, the Vijayanagar Kingdom also ruled independently .

In 1518 the Sultan Qili Qutub Shah declared himself independent and founded the Qutub Shah dynasty which existed till 1687. During this period literature, art and architect are advanced. The city of Hyderabad was laid in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah. The Mughals put an end to the Qutub Shahi rule in 1687. After this the Asafjahis called Nizams emerged.

        "title": "Arunachal Pradesh Tourism",
        "desc": "Arunachal Pradesh located in north eastern India has fifteen districts and is called 'Land of the Rising Sun'. The literary meaning of the 'Land of the Rising Sun' is 'the land of the dawn lit mountains.'' The state has its capital in Itanagar, which is also its largest city. The state, known for its natural beauty is backed by a strong agricultural economy- pulses, sugarcane, rice, wheat, maize being its main crops. It has a considerable amount of forest cover which ensures that the forest products also contribute to its economy. The tourism sector of the state, however, has not been fully utilized.  <br><br><b>History</b><br>The history of pre-modern Arunachal Pradesh is unclear. According to the Arunachal Pradesh government, the Hindu texts Mahabharata mention the region as the Prabhu Mountains of the Puranas, and where sage Parashurama washed away sins, the sage Vyasa meditated, King Bhishmaka founded his kingdom, and Lord Krishna married his consort Rukmini. On the other hand, the Kalika Purana written in the 10th century mentions the region to be ruled by the descendants of a king named Bhirmuko of the Chutika (today's Chutia) clan.<br>Recorded history only became available in the Chutiya chronicles. The Monpa and Sherdukpen do keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. The remaining parts of the state, especially those bordering Myanmar, were under the control of the Chutiya Kings. However, most Arunachali tribes remained in practice largely autonomous up until Indian independence and the formalisation of indigenous administration in 1947.<br>Recent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in West Siang, indicate they were built during the Chutiya reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar (built in 8th century), has led to suggestions that the Chutiya people had an advanced culture and administration in prehistoric times. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old Tawang Monastery in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth Dalai Lama Tsangyang Gyatso was born in Tawang. <br><br><b>Fairs &amp; Festivals</b><br>Fairs and festivals in Arunachal Pradesh are a fine way to understand the state's rich culture and traditional practices.

Celebrated on a grand scale, these festivals are characterized by prayers that are later followed by merry making. Among the most popular festivals of Arunachal Pradesh are Ziro Festival of Music , Losar Festival, Tamladu Festival, Sangken Festival.<br><br><b>Best Time to Visit</b><br>Arunachal is located at a high altitude, and so has pleasant weather throughout the year. However, all activities may not be available at all times, so it is advisable to cross check the availability and seasons for each site or activity. The most preferable months to plan your trip to Arunachal Pradesh are from October to April when the weather is pleasant, and you can move around happily under the clear blue sky to have the most fun.

It is a holy place of worship visited by huge number of visitors and pilgrims every year. The legend says, on the way to Dwarka from Bhismaknagar, Sri Krishna with his newly married wife Rukmini Devi begged blessings of Goddess Parvati. Devi Parvati greeted the newly married couple with wreath. The stringing of the garland was so unique, that overwhelmed Krishna called Devi Parvati as 'Sucharu Malini', or a lady who strings garlands beautifully - hence from Malini the name Malinithan was achieved. The nearest airport from Malinithan is Leelabari or Dibrugarh in Assam. A helipad is also situated at along. From here you can pick a bus to Malinithan.

Protohistory has been reconstructed from folklore: epics like Mahabharata, and two medieval texts compiled in the Assam region—the Kalika Purana and the Yogini Tantra.<br> The history of Assam can be divided into four eras. The ancient era began in the 4th century with the mention of Kamarupa in Samudragupta's inscriptions on the Allahabad pillar and the establishment of the Kamarupa kingdom. The medieval era began with the attacks from the Bengal Sultanate, the first of which took place in 1206 by Bakhtiyar Khilji as mentioned in the Kanai-boroxiboa rock inscription, after the breakup of the ancient kingdom and the sprouting of medieval kingdoms and chieftain-ships in its place. The colonial era began with the establishment of British control after the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, and the post-colonial era began in 1947 after the Independence of India. <br><br> <b>Fairs &amp; Festivals</b><br> Assam is a land of fairs and festivals.

Some major tourist attractions in Jammu and Kashmir are Srinagar, the Mughal Gardens, Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Patnitop, Jammu, and Ladakh. Some areas require a special permit for non-Indians to visit. <br><br><b>History</b><br>The history of Kashmir is intertwined with the history of the broader Indian subcontinent and the surrounding regions, comprising the areas of Central Asia, South Asia and East Asia. Historically, Kashmir referred to the Kashmir Valley. Today, it denotes a larger area that includes the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir (which consists of Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh), the Pakistan-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered regions of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.<br> In the first half of the 1st millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism; later in the ninth century, Shaivism arose. Islamization in Kashmir took place during 13th to 15th century and led to the eventual decline of the Kashmir Shaivism in Kashmir. However, the achievements of the previous civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity and culture which gave rise to Kashmiri Sufi mysticism.  <br><br><b>Fairs &amp; Festivals</b><br>  Fairs and Festivals are part of our rich cultural heritage and are the celebration of life in its many colors and moods. Travel to any part of India and you will find fairs and festivals taking place on important religious days and according to the season. Kashmir too has its fair share of festivals and fairs. Fairs and festivals are when men, women and children come together, mingle, dance, sing and form a medley of colorful dresses to mark a special day before returning to their routine life. Colorful Kashmir itself is a never ending festival, cloaked in a riot of colors in spring, taking on golden crimson hues in autumn and a blanket of pristine white in winter. On special occasions people put on their best finery, the most colorful garments and celebrate fairs and partake in festivals.<br><br> <b>Best Time to Visit</b><br> The best time to visit Jammu is between late September and early March.

Among its mountains is the fabulous Kanchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world. Sikkim is also the least populous state in the Indian union. Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim is situated at a height of over five thousand feet above sea level. <br><br> <b>History</b><br>      The history of Sikkim an area in present-day North-East India, began in 1642 as a kingdom established when India and Nepal were still many princely states with many rulers at that time and had not unified to the present Union of India and present country of Nepal. At that time Sikkim had already solidified into country then with a king known as a Chogyal or dharma king, and till 16 May 1975 was an independent country ruled by the monarchs. Sikkim had twelve kings; Palden Thondup Namgyal was the last king of Independent Sikkim. There was contacts between ancient Hindus and Tibetans, followed by the establishment of a Buddhist kingdom or Chogyal in the 17th century. Sikkim emerged as a polity in its own right against a backdrop of incursions from Tibet and Bhutan, during which the kingdom enjoyed varying degrees of independence. In the early 18th century, the British Empire sought to establish trade routes with Tibet, leading Sikkim to fall under British suzerainty until independence in 1947. Initially, Sikkim remained an independent country, until it merged with India in 1975 after a decisive referendum. Many provisions of the Indian constitution had to be altered to accommodate the international treaties between Sikkim and India.  <br><br> <b>Fairs &amp; Festivals</b><br>   Sikkim, Buddhism and Hinduism are the predominant religions. The Nepalese people are mostly followers of Hinduism, whereas the Sikkimese, Bhotias and Tibetans are mostly followers of Buddhism. On account of this, various festivals are celebrated all through the year in the state. The Fairs and festivals in Sikkim reflect the rich history and culture of this erstwhile kingdom. They are also major contributors towards tourism in Sikkim, attracting numerous tourists from all over the world.  <br><br> <b>Best Time to Visit</b><br>     The temperature in this town during the months of May to September is moderate with the maximum temperature being 28 to 30 degrees Celcius. North Sikkim experiences mild to heavy rainfall during the months of July and September. The weather during the winters is very harsh with the temperatures falling to sub-zero and it is not advisable to visit this town during this time. <br><br><b>How to Reach :-</b><br><br>  <b>BY AIR -</b> Nearest airport from Sikkim is Bagdogra Airport at a distance of 124 km. This airport is connected to major airport of India and Bangkok. Airline companies like Indian Airlines, Spice Jet, and Go Air etc are functional here.      You can further reach Gangtok by availing helicopter service, which is subjected to weather conditions. You can hire a taxi otherwise (Approximately 4 hours drive).<br><br><b>BY RAIL -</b>     Sikkim does not have a proper train network also. The nearest major railway station is New Jalpaiguri (NJP) which is about 6-7kms from Siliguri and 130 km from Gangtok. Very few selective trains also pass through Siliguri, which is approx. 114 km from Gangtok. Onward journey from Siliguri or New Jalpaiguri railway station is also possible by road.<br> <b>BY ROAD -</b>      Siliguri is more or less the main gateway to Sikkim.
