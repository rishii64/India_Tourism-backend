It was first known as Kashi, the city of light, when it was the capital of the kingdom of the same name about 500 B.C. for over 2000 years, Banaras, the eternal city, has been the religious capital of India. Built on the banks of sacred Ganga, it is said to combine the virtues of all other places of pilgrimage and anyone who ends his earthly cycle here is said to be transported straight to heaven.

Its permanent advantages include the highest sanctity, fertile soil, and its location on a great river.<br> <br> Hindu rulers built great palaces, temples and ghats in the city. It is one of the oldest living cities in the world and the ultimate pilgrimage for hindus who believe that to die in the city is to attain instant salvation. Situated on the bank of ganga, varanasi is the tract of holy land lying between the river Varuna and Assi, which flow into the ganga. It derives its name from these two streams. It is also mentioned in late Vedic literature and in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The city encompasses Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon in about 530 B.C. Since one of the twelve 'Jyotirlinga' is installed here. It is believed to be the greatest 'Tirth' or crossing place between the earth and heaven. For a hindu, to visit Varanasi and bath in the water of the Ganga is said to be cleansed of the sins of the thousand of past rebirths. The combination of kashi, the holy city, Ganga the celestial river and Shiva, the supream god, makes Varanasi an immortal place on the earth.
