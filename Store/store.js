        "desc": "Rajasthan tour packages bring you a complete collection of one of a kind tour packages. After all, it is not just a state, it is the pride of its bygone rulers and the joy in the voice of people who say 'Padharo Mhare Desh'. The desire to catch the floating bubbles of culture, traditions, history and its royalty never ends, but travelers can at least start from somewhere with our Rajasthan tour Packages. Enjoy camel fairs, wildlife attractions, historic forts palaces, lakes and much more. The best places to visit in Rajasthan is Jaipur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Mandawa, Ranakapur, Mount Abu, there are hundreds of attractions and activities to enjoy. The very name of Rajasthan conjures up the image of hilltop fortresses, maharajas with scimitars riding the painted elephants, the exquisitely carved havelis and the royal hunting grounds. Our Rajasthan holiday packages are designed to offer you a peek into the era where all you get to relish are opulence and artistry. These small things counted together make Rajasthan one of the most popular tourist places in India. Ajmer-Pushkar Ajmer (pronounced 'Uh-j-mare') is a popular pilgrimage centre famous for its Dargah Sharif-tomb of the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti. Ajmer is also the base for visiting Pushkar (pronounced 'Push-cur'). A 30 minute uphill drive will take you to this famous tourist destination that is renowned for its Hindu pilgrimage spots, flea market and great roadside food. You can get some amazing pictures of Indian sadhus here. Bikaner Bikaner (pronounced 'Beeka-nair') is famous for its palaces and its intricately sculptured red and yellow sandstone temples. The climate in Bikaner is characterised by extreme variations in temperature, so be sure to carry weather-appropriate clothing while visiting. However, despite its rugged climate, it is said that Bikaner was once an oasis town used as a stop-over on the trade route between Central Asia and India. It's always interesting to plan a trip around the time of the Bikaner Camel festival, usually held in January. Jaipur Aptly nicknamed 'The Pink City' for its peculiar affinity for pink stone buildings Jaipur is part of the famous Golden Triangle of cities formed with Delhi and Agra as the other two corners. A bustling capital city and business centre today, Jaipur still retains a royal charm that never fails to surprise. Jaipur is home to several stunning ancient forts. A great time to visit is during January when the annual Literary Festival is held.<br> Jaisalmer 'The Golden City' of Jaisalmer (pronounced 'Jey-sull-mare') is popular for its 12th century Jaisalmer Fort as well as beautiful havelis, miles of smooth yellow sand dunes, and camel safaris. Well known for its camel hide artefacts and the stupendous musical and dance talent of its native people, Jaisalmer is the very heart of the Thar Desert. Jodhpur Jodhpur is a city with a long and captivating history. While India was still under British colonization, the walled city of Jodhpur had the largest land area of all Rajputana provinces. Today, it is a flourishing centre of handicraft export and tourism, with tons of hotels and palace resorts. Jodhpur has contributed significantly to the culinary traditions of the country. We strongly recommend a visit to the famous Umaid Bhavan Palace to soak in some history. Ranthambore Once a princely game conserve, the sanctuary at Ranthambore (pronounced 'Run-thum-bore') is home to the beautiful Indian tiger. Ranthambore National Park is open from October to May every year. You will also get a chance to see an abandoned fortress and lake and take pictures of the gazillion monkeys that are oddly human in their behaviour. Don't miss a chance to visit the majestic Nahargarh Palace Hotel run by the very hospitable royal family there. It's gorgeous, especially at night. Katy Perry had her much publicised royal wedding there. Udaipur Udaipur is known as the 'City of Lakes' in view of the 8 prominent lakes within its limits. The Lake Palace Hotel in the middle of Lake Pichola is a spectacular sight especially when lit up at night. Other big tourist attractions include the 'Shilpgram Fair' which is a craftsmen's village showcasing ethnic craft, art culture and the 'City Palace' with its various towers, domes, arches and courtyards. The live cultural show at 'Bagore ki Haveli' is worth a visit. Udaipur has been used as a backdrop for lots of movies including the James Bond flick 'Octopussy.' Mount Abu Rajasthan has a hill station. And it is like a breath of fresh air in the all that desert aridity. Mount Abu was once the summer capital of Maharajas. Today it makes for a fine holiday destination, situated as it is on a hill. The place also holds special religious importance for Jains. Boating in Lake Nakki, visiting Dhrudhiya waterfalls and exploring the lush Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary are just some of the attractions here. The most famous one is Dilwara Jain Temple. Chittorgarh Chittorgarh is a town not too far from Udaipur. It has a glorious past with some of the most valiant Rajasthani rulers; from Rawal Ratan Singh of Chittor to Samar Singh who became one of the topmost allies of Prithviraj Chauhan's army. The revered Queen Padmavati, who was as beautiful as she was brave is also credited to this land. Today Chittorgarh is home to many forts, ruins and temples; making for a historian's paradise. A 1-2 day trip is a must to Chittorgarh when you are visiting Udaipur.",

City of many names, Banaras as it is most commonly called, was officially renamed in 1956 as Varanasi. It was first known as Kashi, the city of light, when it was the capital of the kingdom of the same name about 500 B.C. for over 2000 years, Banaras, the eternal city, has been the religious capital of India. Built on the banks of sacred Ganga, it is said to combine the virtues of all other places of pilgrimage and anyone who ends his earthly cycle here is said to be transported straight to heaven. Banaras was also celebrated as the place where the most profound wisdom dwelt, the seat of all enlightenment and learning. Its permanent advantages include the highest sanctity, fertile soil, and its location on a great river. Hindu rulers built great palaces, temples and ghats in the city. It is one of the oldest living cities in the world and the ultimate pilgrimage for hindus who believe that to die in the city is to attain instant salvation. Situated on the bank of ganga, varanasi is the tract of holy land lying between the river Varuna and Assi, which flow into the ganga. It derives its name from these two streams. It is also mentioned in late Vedic literature and in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. The city encompasses Sarnath, where Buddha preached his first sermon in about 530 B.C. Since one of the twelve 'Jyotirlinga' is installed here. It is believed to be the greatest 'Tirth' or crossing place between the earth and heaven. For a hindu, to visit Varanasi and bath in the water of the Ganga is said to be cleansed of the sins of the thousand of past rebirths. The combination of kashi, the holy city, Ganga the celestial river and Shiva, the supream god, makes Varanasi an immortal place on the earth. Varanasi has been a great cultural centre, especially in the field of music, learning and the craft of weaving. Some of the most renowned exponent of music have drawn there inspiration from Varanasi. Banaras brocades are treasured textiles and considered as collector's items.  TOURIST ATTRACTIONS IN VARANASI:<br> The Ghats Of Varanasi: In this ancient city of pilgrimage, the bathing ghats are main attraction.
